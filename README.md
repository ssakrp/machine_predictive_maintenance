# machine_predictive_maintenance
Data science project with multi classification problem. Data analysis + machine learning.
This dataset reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry. Every entry in the data is a machine with set of features. Our goal is detect a reason of failure according to the feature values. To do it I have to analyze this dataset and after it I have to create a model, which can classify type of machine failure with high value of metric. So I have multi classification machine learning problem.
